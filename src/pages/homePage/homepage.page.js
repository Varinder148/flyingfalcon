      <span>In the distant distant galaxy of Tara B.</span>
      <span>
        After the recent war with neighbouring planet Falicornia, King Shan has
        exiled the Queen of Falicornia for 15 years.
      </span>
      Queen Al Falcone is now in hiding. But if King Shan can find her before
      the years are up, she will be exiled for another 15 yearsâ€¦
    </p>
    <p>
      King Shan has received intelligence that Al Falcone is in hiding in one of
      these 6 planets - DonLon, Enchai, Jebing, Sapir, Lerbin and Pingasor.
      However he has limited resources at his disposal and can send his army to
      only 4 of these planets.
